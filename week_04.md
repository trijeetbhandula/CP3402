## Content Insights

I attempted to set up WordPress on my local computer, but faced challenges due to software compatibility issues with Mac M1 chip. Consequently, I completed this week's practical on the University's computer, using the USB webserver and configuring the WordPress database.

Choosing WordPress over Joomla was driven by its user-friendly interface and broader range of functionalities.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week's activities, including attending seminars, practical classes, and using the USB webserver, collectively took around 6 to 7 hours. While attempting to set up WordPress locally, I encountered challenges due to Mac M1 chip compatibility issues, leading me to complete the practical on the University's computer using the USB webserver.

A valuable lesson learned was the importance of backing up work to avoid potential setbacks. During Joomla assignment editing, unintended changes led to a server error, requiring significant effort for recovery. This emphasized the necessity of regular backups for a smoother and hassle-free workflow.

On a positive note, exploring powerful themes in WordPress provided insights into efficient website customization with minimal effort, enhancing my knowledge in this area.
