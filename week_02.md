## Content Insights

Learning CMS was entirely new for me, and it was both interesting and a bit tricky. The pre-recorded lectures and GitHub instructions felt a bit limited, leading me to rely on various sources to figure things out on my own. This took more time, and having an extra week after the practical class could have made exploring things easier.

Working with Joomla to create a website had its ups and downs. Figuring out the tools was a bit tough, but not having to write code made things simpler. Overall, I realized the importance of having more comprehensive resources and a bit more time to explore and understand everything better.
## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After completing the Joomla practical, I delved into the Joomla help guide, watched pre-recorded lectures, and attended a seminar. Consulting various guides, including the Joomla Administrators Portal, enhanced my understanding. This mixed learning approach, combining hands-on tasks with external resources, proved effective. It underscored the importance of diverse learning materials and aligns with my preference for a strategic blend of guides, hands-on work, and revisiting tutorials. This adaptable approach enhances comprehension and skill acquisition beyond immediate requirements.agement, crucial for professional settings. As I progress, refining time management skills is a priority for a focused and efficient approach to assignments.
