# Week 8 Learning Journal

## Learning Activities

### Hypothesis:
I hypothesize that implementing user testing sessions for website usability will lead to better insights into user preferences and improve the effectiveness of content organization in CMS platforms.

### Test:
1. **Baseline Assessment:**
   - Conduct a baseline assessment of the current content organization and user experience on a CMS-based website.

2. **Implementation of User Testing:**
   - Recruit participants for user testing sessions to evaluate the usability of the website.
   - Design test scenarios to assess the effectiveness of content organization, navigation structure, and overall user experience.
   - Use tools like usability testing platforms or conduct in-person sessions to gather feedback from participants.

3. **Analysis and Iteration:**
   - Analyze the feedback collected from user testing sessions to identify areas for improvement in content organization and user experience.
   - Implement changes based on the insights gained from user testing sessions.
   - Conduct follow-up assessments to measure the impact of implemented changes on website usability.

### Results:
Compare the usability metrics and user feedback gathered after implementing user testing sessions with the baseline assessment to determine if there is a noticeable improvement in content organization and user experience on the CMS-based website.

## Estimated Hours
Approximately 6 to 8 hours

## Learning Insights
This week, I conducted a learning experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of user testing sessions in improving content organization and user experience on a CMS-based website. By gathering feedback directly from users, I aimed to gain valuable insights into their preferences and behaviors, which could inform future decisions related to website design and optimization.

The results of the experiment will provide insights into the impact of user testing on website usability and highlight the importance of incorporating user feedback into the content management process. Additionally, this experiment serves as a valuable learning experience in applying user-centered design principles to CMS platforms and enhancing the overall user experience.
